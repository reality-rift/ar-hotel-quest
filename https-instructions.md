# Fix WebXR Issues - Enable HTTPS

## The Problem
Quest 3 requires HTTPS for:
- ✅ WebXR access
- ✅ Camera permissions  
- ✅ AR functionality

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Use ngrok (Easiest)
1. **Install ngrok**: Download from https://ngrok.com/
2. **Run your current server**: `python3 server.py`
3. **In another terminal**: `ngrok http 58462`
4. **Use the HTTPS URL** it provides (like `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### Option 2: Use GitHub Codespaces (Free)
1. **Upload your files** to GitHub repository
2. **Open in Codespaces**
3. **Run server** - automatically gets HTTPS
4. **Access from Quest** using the Codespaces URL

### Option 3: Deploy to Netlify/Vercel (Free)
1. **Drag & drop** your AR folder to https://netlify.com/drop
2. **Get instant HTTPS URL**
3. **Access from Quest**

### Option 4: Local HTTPS (Advanced)
```bash
# If you have OpenSSL installed
python3 create-https-server.py
```

## Why This Fixes Everything
- **HTTPS** ✅ Enables secure context
- **Camera** ✅ Browser can access camera  
- **WebXR** ✅ VR/AR APIs become available

## Recommended: Try ngrok first
It's the fastest way to get HTTPS without changing your setup!

## After HTTPS is working:
1. **Green checkmarks** should appear for all features
2. **WebXR button** will work properly
3. **Quest 3 AR** will launch successfully
4. **Hand tracking** will be available
